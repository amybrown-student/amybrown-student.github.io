<p>Welcome to my website!  Here you can learn all about my boring life. </p>
<p>Amy is currently a student at the University of Maine. She hopes to complete her degree in Business Management with a minor in Accounting in the fall of 2018. A current resident of Newburgh, Maine, Amy lives with her family and commutes from home, but has lived in Orono in the past and plans on getting an apartment in the Bangor area this summer. 
Amy is an avid car enthusiast and takes great pride in her Audi. She also enjoys exercising, outdoor activities, as well as spending time with friends, family, and her grumpy dog, Ozzy.   </p>
