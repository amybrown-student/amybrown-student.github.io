<h2> All About Ozzy</h2>

<p><img src="ozzy.JPG"alt="ozzy.JPG"hspace="20"> <img src="IMG_1746.JPG"alt="IMG_1746.JPC"hspace="20">

<p>Ozzy is an eight-year-old Shih Tzu that I got for my thirteenth birthday. He was the 
sleepiest puppy I had ever seen. He really didn't do much! Not much has changed. He still
enjoys sunbathing in front of the glass sliding door, having an animal cracker or a piece
of turkey as a light snack, and growling at anyone who tries to pick him up without 
"asking" him for his permission. 
<p>Ozzy knows several tricks. These tricks include: sit, down, dance, shake, and wag. He 
usually will perform for free, but extra enthusiasm is added when a yummy treat is 
present in his owner's hand.
